My corpus consists of female British and American rappers. I chose this corpus because I listen to a lot of female British rap, but I was never really interested in American rap. I am curious to know what sets the two apart and uncover the elements that make each stand out. I wanted to specifically focus on female rappers because they have been underrepresented in the hip-hop genre and I wanted to explore their unique musical styles. 

The groups within my corpus are female British and American rappers. I expect to find differences in the musical styles, lyrical themes, and cultural references between the two. I also expect to find similarities in their use of hip-hop beats. I am unsure about the extent to which their respective cultures will influence their music.

The tracks in my corpus are a good representative sample of the female sub-genre for both countries but may not be representative of the entire rap genre in each country and may not include all the important artists within the genre.

In the female American hip-hop and rap scene, some typical tracks include "Money" by Cardi B and "WAP" by Megan Thee Stallion. They are confident and bold lyrics about female empowerment and sexuality. An atypical track in the American scene would be "Self" by Noname, which has a much slower beat.

In the female British hip-hop and rap scene, typical tracks include "Offence" by Little Simz and “Mad Love” by Mabel. These tracks are typical for UK rap sound. An atypical track in the British scene would be "Introvert" by Little Simz, which has a more alternative and experimental sound.
