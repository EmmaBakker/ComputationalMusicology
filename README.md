# ComputationalMusicology

For my portfolio, I have chosen a corpus that compares classical music with film soundtracks. The corpus will include track from the “Classical Essential” and “Iconic Soundtracks” playlists on Spotify. I am interested in this because both classical music and film soundtracks can evoke emotions in listeners, but the audiences of both can be very different, which is why I want to see what differentiates the two.

In my corpus I will compare classical compositions with film soundtracks. Within these groups, there are various natural subgroups such as individual composers, specific movies, and musical genres. I expect to find differences in instrumentation and production between the two groups, as well as differences between individual composers and genres. However, I also anticipate finding commonalities in melody, harmony, and musical structure.

The tracks in my corpus are representative of the groups I want to compare, but there are probably some recordings missing or variations that could affect the analysis. For example, there may be differences between the live and studio versions of a classical piece that are not reflected in the corpus. I will keep this in mind when the data.

One atypical track in my corpus is "Hedwig's Theme" by John Williams, which for most of the track uses only the celesta and a unique melody. A typical track is "Für Elise" by Ludwig van Beethoven, which is a well-known classical piece with a recognizable melody.
